# DPM-Project

Java code and associated HTML documentation for our final project of ECSE-211: the design of an autonomous robot with ultrasonic and light sensors capable of navigating a map and launching ping-pong balls at targets.

Videos of our tests and of the robot in action can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9ATqTSk6JkNMvxZO9Ahfw).
